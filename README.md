# About Me:
### _My Interests_
  I really enjoy gaming, spending time with my family, and fur babies. I love to be outside, go for walks with my dog, and tend to the garden.
### _Websites I reccomend_ 
  * [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com) - I enjoy it because it is a huge library of videos. You have access to so many videos that can assist you in a recipe, fixing items, or just watching/ listening to music videos. 
  * [WRAL] (https://www.wral.com) - This website is great for staying up to date on local news and weather.
